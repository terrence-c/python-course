## Installing Git

To install Git, go to the [git homepage](http://git-scm.com/) and click the Downloads button for your operating system (Mac OS X, Linux, Windows) on the right side.

Before continuing, this is a good time to read Section 2.1 and the start of Section 2.2 (only through the subsection "Ignoring Files") of Pro Git:
