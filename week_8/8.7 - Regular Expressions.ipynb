It is similar to a regular string literal, but Python won't replace any characters when it is interpreted.  For example, `\"\\b\"` will remain as it is, instead of being replaced by a backspace character. It is safe practice to surround all of your patterns with `\"r''\"` to prevent this type of substitution.\n",
