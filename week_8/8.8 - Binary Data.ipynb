For example, the byte 00000101 is given the number 5, while 10000000 is given the number 128.  This is not to suggest that any given byte is meant to represent a number - the data in a byte could be used to represent many different things.  The base 10 representation just gives us a friendly way to write down what data is contained in a byte.  There is one base 10 integer for each of the 256 possible sequences of one's and zero's in a byte.\n",
