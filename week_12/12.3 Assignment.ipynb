It might be funny to say that the U.S. population is just plain grumpier than the U.K. population when it comes to writing airline reviews. However, we can't prove that beyond a reasonable doubt simply because the make-up of the populations is drastically different. For example, only one person flew on Spirit Airlines from the United Kingdom, while nearly 1,000 flew on Spirit Airlines from the United States. Spirit Airlines might just be a worse experience overall.\n",
