    "Properties are an advanced feature of Python that you won't see too often, but it's worth knowing what they look like in case you encounter them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we discussed different ways of accessing a class's data attributes.  If all we need to do is get the value and set the value, it's more appropriate to access the attribute directly.  If we have to do extra processing or control access in some way, we can do that with getter and setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be situations in which you first write a program that accesses a data attribute directly, then change your mind.  Perhaps you realized that some basic processing is needed when setting a value, but you don't want to rewrite all the code in your larger program.  You would like to add the functionality of a setter method without changing the interface to your class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows us to do this with a feature called properties.  In the code below, suppose we created our Drone class with a non-hidden altitude attribute."

In our case, the additional processing we added is really minimal, so the property is a reasonable solution.\n",
