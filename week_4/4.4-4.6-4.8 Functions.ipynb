To do this, the interpreter uses a data structure known as a call stack or execution stack.\n",

The first is the main program, labeled module() here. The next frame tells you that control entered the distance_to_origin function. The final frame tells you that control entered the sqrt function.  Finally, the error message can be seen: \"division by zero.\" This type of printout can help you understand what was happening in your program when something went wrong. It is an important tool for debugging."
