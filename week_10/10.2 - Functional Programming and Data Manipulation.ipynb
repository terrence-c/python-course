    "## What Is Functional Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm, or a style of writing code.  It is an alternative to the object-oriented framework that we have been working with up to this point. Rather than keeping state in an object like OOP, functional programming is declarative and emphasizes the use of functions to perform computation. At the core of functional programming is a simple idea: the output of a function should depend only on the arguments passed into the function. This means that calling function f with parameter x will always return the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, it may be hard to understand why a functional approach is useful or desirable.  Some (if not most) of the code that we wrote for this course violates this principle. This is really an obvious point, but let's reinforce it with another example."

    "## Why Functional Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is a way to avoid the problems we have been discussing.  Instead of using objects with mutable state, functional programmers organize a program into functions, none of which has any side effect.  The execution of a program is then viewed as the evaluation of functions.  There is no state except for the values being passed into functions and returned from functions, which are stored in the execution stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very different way of viewing programs, and it may seem unintuitive if you are used to object-oriented programs.  In fact, while object-oriented programming is still dominant in modern software development, functional programs are quite useful in some places.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to advocates, one of the great benefits of a functional approach is code reliability.  In a functional program, the same function call will always return the same result, so there is less potential for problems to pop up after initial testing.  This is one reason that functional programming has been applied to fault-resistant telecommunications networks.  As another benefit, functional programming enforces good code modularity, forcing programmers to divide tasks into subtasks with clear results.  Functional programming is also widely used for writing parallelized algorithms that distribute computation over many computer servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not suggesting that you should use a functional style for all of your code.  In the context of a data analysis, however, we will see that Python's data libraries are well suited to a functional style.  Understanding how functional programming works will help you derive the greatest benefit from these packages.  Let's examine some Python components that fit closely with a functional programming paradigm."
